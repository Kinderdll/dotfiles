## Features ‚ú®
* Adds "Scope to This" option to the Explorer context menu to scope the selected directory.
* Adds "Clear scope" option to the Folders view as a shortcut icon (also available as a command `scope-to-this.clear`) to clear the filter and return to the project's root folder.

## Known Issues üêõ

* To scope we use the `file.exclude` option in the `settings.json` configuration file. This file may be included in the Git repository. So be careful when you commit...

* Folders and files that have the same prefix as the selected folder name may still appear. For example, if you want to scope to the `.vscode` folder, folders and files like `.vs` and `.vscodeignore` will still be visible.
